# AllerVis

An interactive web application for visualizing consumption of food allergens across the world.

# Running it locally

You can run AllerVis locally using Python3:

```
python allervis.py
```

It might be necessary to update libraries/packages.

# Files

All the relevant code for AllerVis is in `allervis.py`. We wrote the entirety of this file.

The folders `Food and Allergies Data` contains all the data used by AllerVis. The folder `data_cleaning` is not necessary to run the application -- it contains the code we wrote during the data wrangling.

The files `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` contain specifications for our app to run in Heroku.

The `.idea` folder contains automatically generated files for nice usage in PyCharm.
